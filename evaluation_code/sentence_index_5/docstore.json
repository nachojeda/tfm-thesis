The best\nperforming models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention\nmechanism.  We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer,\nbased solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions\nentirely.  Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to\nbe superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring signi\ufb01cantly\nless time to train.  Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-\nto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including\nensembles, by over 2 BLEU.
