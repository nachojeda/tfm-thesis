# Master Thesis Project: AI Application Using OpenAI's LLM

## Overview
🤖 This is my Master thesis project, which focuses on developing an AI application capable of answering specific questions about a topic. The core of this application is a Large Language Model (LLM) from OpenAI.

### Features
- 📚 **Access to External Data**: The model can pull in information it hasn't seen during its training phase.
